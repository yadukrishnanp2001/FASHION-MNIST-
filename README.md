# FASHION-MNIST-
Journey into the realm of deep learning with this comprehensive project dedicated to Fashion MNIST classification using TensorFlow and Keras. By combining theoretical foundations with practical implementation, this repository offers a structured approach to understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. The project begins with data preprocessing techniques such as scaling, followed by the development of a robust CNN architecture. With an emphasis on achieving high accuracy, the trained model showcases its efficacy by accurately classifying clothing items with an impressive accuracy of 90.2%. Detailed evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, provide valuable insights into the model's performance. Additionally, interactive visualizations allow users to explore model predictions, making this project a valuable resource for enthusiasts and practitioners alike.
