# FASHION-MNIST
Journey into the realm of deep learning with this comprehensive project dedicated to Fashion MNIST classification using TensorFlow and Keras. By combining theoretical foundations with practical implementation, this repository offers a structured approach to understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. The project begins with data preprocessing techniques such as scaling, followed by the development of a robust CNN architecture. Trained model showcases its efficacy by accurately classifying clothing items with an accuracy of 90.2%. Detailed evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, provide valuable insights into the model's performance. Additionally, interactive visualizations allow users to explore model predictions, making this project a valuable resource for enthusiasts and practitioners alike.
